## 🛠 How I Learned
I’ve been practicing JavaScript daily for **6+ months**. My approach:
1. Learn a topic from trusted resources ([javascript.info](https://javascript.info), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), YouTube tutorials).  
2. Write my own **examples and explanations** in `.js` files.  
3. Convert handwritten notes into Markdown for **interview prep**.  
4. Use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to clarify doubts and explore different approaches.

## 🚦 Next Steps
- Keep converting handwritten notes into Markdown.  
- Add more on **Fetch API, Event Loop, Closures, and Performance optimizations**.
