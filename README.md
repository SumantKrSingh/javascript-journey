# JavaScript Notes & Practice

This repo contains my **JavaScript notes and coding practice** that I have been doing for the past 6+ months.  
It includes:

- Topic-wise notes (Basics, DOM, OOP, Async JS, etc.)
- Practice code snippets and exercises
- Problem-solving examples

I created this repo mainly for:

- ðŸ“š Revising concepts quickly
- ðŸ’» Tracking my learning journey
- ðŸš€ Showcasing consistency in JavaScript practice
